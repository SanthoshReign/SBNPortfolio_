# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Titanic Dataset:

### Objective: 
  Performed an in-depth EDA on the Titanic dataset to understand passenger demographics, survival rates, and factors influencing survival.
### Tools Used: 
  Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook.
### Key Findings:
  1. Survival Analysis: Analyzed survival rates by gender, age, and class. Found that women and children had higher survival rates, and first-class passengers had a better chance of survival.
  2. Visualization: Created a series of visualizations, including histograms, bar plots, and heatmaps, to illustrate the relationships between various features and survival outcomes.

# RSVP Movies Dataset using SQL:

### Objective: 
  Performed data analysis on IMDB movie dataset and found key insights into movie performance, genre popularity, and production house success.
### Tools Used: 
  SQL (MySQL), MySQL Workbench.
### Key Findings:
  1. The top three genres with the highest number of movies Drama, Comedy, and Thriller were identified as critical areas for investment due to their consistent performance and producting the most hits.
  2. Multilingual movies often receive higher votes and ratings. This shows the importance of catering to diverse audiences.


# Machine Learning Lead Scoring Project: 
### Objective:
  An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. The company thinks that the conversion rate is very low and wants to improve it. To do so, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads called ‘Hot lead’. To identify these hot leads, we need to build a model to find features contributing more on the lead conversion rate. Here, we need to find whether the lead will take the course or not. Therefore, the machine learning algorithm we have to use is logistic regression because it follows classification technique. We’re using a lead conversion past dataset consists of 9240 data points. The target variable used for building the model is ‘Converted’.
  
### Tools Used:
  Python, Jupyter Notebook, Machine Learning Algorithm - Logistic Regression

### Key Findings:
  The area covered by the ROC curve is 0.86 which is perfectly good to continue. The optimal predicted cutoff is calculated by plotting graph with different probabilities. The accuracy of training and testing data are 0.790 and 0.797 respectively. The top 3 categorical/dummy variables in the model which should be focused the most on in order to increase the probability of lead conversion are -'Lead Source_Welingak Website', -'Lead Origin_Lead Add Form', and -'Last Notable Activity_Unreachable'.
  - The top recommendations are
      1. Increase user engagement by optimizing website experience.
      2. Target leads that spend more time and revisit the website.
      3. Focus marketing efforts on Lead Add Form and Welingak Website sources.
      4. Monitor "Unreachable" leads for additional follow-ups.
